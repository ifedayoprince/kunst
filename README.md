An easy-to-use, standard ALX bootstrapper.

Kunst generates the file and directory structure of an ALX project based on an exported HTML file from the Intranet.


## How to Use?

- Install Kunst on your local machine.
```bash
npm install -g kunst
```

- Head over to the project on your ALX Intranet and complete the quiz.

- Refresh the page and download as HTML-only page (rename if you like).

- Navigate to the directory you stored it
```
cd path/to/folder/containing/the/html
```

- Run Kunst
```
kunst <file_name>
```

That's it! Let's run `tree` so you can see it properly.

Kunst read the HTML file and created all the files we needed to do the project.

It even generates boilerplate code to fill them.

# Fun facts
- Kunst was built because I'm lazy.
- Kunst was initially named Etch but that name was taken already.
- Kunst was built in less than 4 hours.
- Kunst is pronounced `coo-nst` not `const`. It's German for `art` (I felt like it).
