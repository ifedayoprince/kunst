# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development
==============================
I learnt:
- Something
- Something


## Tasks: 
- **0. Integers addition**: 
Write a function that adds 2 integers.

Prototype: def add_integer(a, b=98):
a and b must be integers or floats, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message a must be an integer or b must be an integer
a and b must be first casted to integers if they are float
Returns an integer: the addition of a and b
You are not allowed to import any module

- **1. Divide a matrix**: 
Write a function that divides all elements of a matrix.

Prototype: def matrix_divided(matrix, div):
matrix must be a list of lists of integers or floats, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
Each row of the matrix must be of the same size, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message Each row of the matrix must have the same size
div must be a number (integer or float), otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message div must be a number
div can’t be equal to 0, otherwise raise a ZeroDivisionError exception with the message division by zero
All elements of the matrix should be divided by div, rounded to 2 decimal places 
Returns a new matrix
You are not allowed to import any module

- **2. Say my name**: 
Write a function that prints My name is <first name> <last name>

Prototype: def say_my_name(first_name, last_name=""):
first_name and last_name must be strings otherwise, raise a TypeError exception with the message first_name must be a string or last_name must be a string
You are not allowed to import any module

- **3. Print square**: 
Write a function that prints a square with the character #.

Prototype: def print_square(size):
size is the size length of the square
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
if size is a float and is less than 0, raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
You are not allowed to import any module

- **4. Text indentation**: 
Write a function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: ., ? and :

Prototype: def text_indentation(text):
text must be a string, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message text must be a string
There should be no space at the beginning or at the end of each printed line
You are not allowed to import any module

- **5. Max integer - Unittest**: 
Since the beginning you have been creating “Interactive tests”. For this exercise, you will add Unittests.

Your test file should be inside a folder tests
You have to use the unittest module 
Your test file should be python files (extension: .py)
Your test file should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests.6-max_integer_test 
All tests you make must be passable by the function below
We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case
